## A data analysis project on one of Nigeria most visited forum websites

A python script that scrapes the site was written. Each thread that makes it to the Forum's front page was extracted with associated data like thread category it belongs to, number of views gotten, number of comments made on the thread (approximation), name of poster, some key words in the thread topic, timed created, time pushed to front page, etc. All these data then saved to a CSV file. The script can be run every day and only new threads will be extracted and written to the file.

Another jupyter script was then written to perfrom the real analysis with appropriate visuals. Few analysis are performed against the already extracted data, these include hour-period of the day threads are mostly pushed to the front page, thread category with most threads, top posters with mostfront page threads, most common thread keywords (topics) in the last seven days, day of the week with most thread, average number of topics posted per day, etc.
